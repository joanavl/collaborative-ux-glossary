## <a name="3"></a>3

### <a name="3-click-rule"></a>3-Click Rule
A theory of website navigation prevalent in the early 2000s suggesting that a user of a website should be able to find any information with no more than three mouse clicks or they would leave out of frustration. It's now widely accepted as nonsense; usability studies disprove the theory's link to user satisfaction or success rates and instead link these to 'information scent'.  

## <a name="5"></a>5

### <a name="5-second-test"></a>5 Second Test
As the name suggests, the 5-Second Test involves showing users a single content page for a quick 5 seconds. The aim is to gather a participant's initial impressions and assess the screen's clarity and conciseness using simple questions like "What is the most important information on the page?" or "How would you go about achieving your goal on this screen?". The setup is similar to a standard usability test, and may sometimes be combined with one. 

## <a name="8"></a>8

### <a name="80-20-rule"></a>80/20 Rule
A common rule of thumb in business stating that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes, based on phenomena shown empirically to exhibit such a probability distribution. Adapted for UX it might be true that "80% of the errors in a given system could be eliminated by fixing 20% of the most-reported bugs". Also known as the Pareto principle or the 'law of the vital few'.

## <a name="a"></a>A

### <a name="a-b-testing"></a>A/B Testing
A form of statistical hypothesis testing used predominantly in marketing and business intelligence. Two or more variants (i.e. a 'control' A and a variation 'B') are measured during a controlled experiment to determine which changes will increase or maximise an outcome of interest (especially regarding conversion rates and click-through rates). Also known as split testing or bucket testing.

### <a name="adaptive-design"></a>Adaptive web design
Like Responsive web design it is an approach to web design aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience on different screen and devices. The difference is that adaptive design is less fluid then RWD, and 'serves' few fixed width versions of the design depending on viewport size. It can utilise server side techniques to 'detect' viewport size prior to rendering html. The advantage for designer is that it gives more control over images and typography, and hence is easier approach to 'retrofit' fixed width websitest to work on mobile devices. 

### <a name="affinity-diagramming"></a>Affinity diagramming
A business tool used to organise a large number of ideas, sorting them into groups based on their natural relationships, for review and analysis.

### <a name="agile"></a>Agile software development methodology

### <a name="paper-prototype"></a>Paper prototype

### <a name="personas"></a>Personas
A fictitious identity that reflects one of the user groups for who you are designing.

### <a name="production-stage"></a>Production stage
The stage at which the high-fidelity design is fleshed out, content and digital assets are created, and a high-fidelity version of the product is validated with stakeholders and end-users through user testing sessions. The role of the UX Designer shifts from creating and validating ideas to collaborating with developers to guide and champion the vision.

### <a name="project-kick-off"></a>Project kick-off
The formally recognised start of a project.

### <a name="progressive-disclosure"></a>Progressive disclosure
An interactive design technique that helps maintain the focus of a user's attention by reducing clutter, confusion, and cognitive workload.

Defining the red routes for your site means that you'll be able to identify and eliminate any usability obstacles on the key user journeys.
(Important roads in London are known as 'red routes' and Transport for London do everything in their power to make sure passenger journeys on these routes are completed as smoothly and quickly as possible.)

### <a name="research-stage"></a>Research stage

### <a name="storyboard"></a>Storyboard

### <a name="survey"></a>Survey	
An online form designed to solicit feedback from current or potential users.

### <a name="stakeholder-interviews"></a>Stakeholder Interviews
Conversations with the key contacts in the client organisation funding, selling, or driving the product.

The practice of assessing and making recommendations to improve the usability of a product.

### <a name="ucd"></a>User-centred design (UCD)
